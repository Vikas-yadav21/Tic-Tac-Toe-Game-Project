# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game-Project
The Tic Tac Toe game is a two-player game created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML structures the 3x3 grid, CSS styles the board, and JavaScript manages the game logic, allowing players to take turns, check for winners, and reset the game. It's a fun project for practicing web development skills.
